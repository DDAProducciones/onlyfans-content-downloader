Any/all potential risks involved regarding your OnlyFans-account are not mine to bare. This project has been developed by me, solely to test and to better my coding-skills.

## Features
- Bulk download all the photos, videos, archives from your OnlyFans-subscription(s).
- Downloads differently from alternative OnlyFans-content scrapers/downloaders.
- Finds and downloads all of the specified content, not just a part of it.
- Does not break easily and requires less maintenance.
- No cookie, session or other information required.

## Requirements
Still in progress, I'm still alternating/changing the code so the dependencies/requirements may change fast. Because of this I decided to stall writing about it until I release a v1 even though it already works stably.

## Setup
Still in progress... (already works, but want to make the code smaller and remove some currently necessary setup steps to make it even easier. This will save me from writing the setup multiple times.)
